`enveloppe` is a simple script I can fetch from any web-connected machine to import my shell environment preferences (prompt, aliases, functions, etc.).

It is not meant to persist on the host, it just avoids the pain of using someone else's questionable tastes when I put my hand on their machine.

```
source ./enveloppe
```
